<<< APPLICATION SUMMARY >>>
- perform frequenecy-distribution analysis on a group of text documents in a directory
- INPUT     - path to directory containing text documents to analyze
- OUTPUTS   - frequency-distribution plot as .png
            - pairs of words & their counts as .csv

<<< INSTALL, CUSTOMIZE, & RUN APPLICATION >>>

(1) Install Python

- Go to URL and install Python 3:
https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Run Installer

(2) Install Windows-Terminal

- Go to URL and download Windows-Terminal:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab
- Run Installer

(3) Program Folder Setup

- Unzip folder and place it where you want to use it
- Open Windows-Terminal (use default Powershell) as Administrator
- Enter into working folder in terminal using "cd" command 

(4) Install Python App

- Open "install.txt" file in current directory
- copy all lines of code, and paste them into Windows-Terminal
- hit ENTER and all dependencies will be installed
- all libraries will be installed locally, so just delete the folder to remove program and dependencies

(5) HOW TO RUN APPLICATION

- With everything installed, now you can Run the python application with the following command:

    python .\word_freqdist_app.py

- You will be prompted to provide the directory-path of the folder that holds your multiple text documents to analyze (multiple doc formats supported)
- The path must have the following format (depending on if you are using WindowsOS or LinuxOS)
(windows):  C:\Users\User\Desktop\text_directory\
(linux):    /home/user/Desktop/text_directory/

(6) Customize Analysis with Stopwords

- You can edit the custom_stopwords.py file to customize your frequency distribution analysis
- add stopwords to the new_stopwords array, in order to filter specific words out of the analysis (eg. words like 'the', 'a', etc.) 
- add stopwords to the ignore_stopwords array, in order to remove words from the default stopwords list

(7) Customize Figure Output

- Change values in the figure_parameters.py file to edit the figure image output
- WARNING: do not change the fig_params object, or it will break the algorithm!
